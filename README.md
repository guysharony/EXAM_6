# EXAM 6

The following content is the **NEW SUBJECT AND VALID ANSWERS for exam nÂ°6 under LINUX**.

You can find my answers in **./rendu/mini_serv.c**.

The **./subject/** folder contains everything provided to you during the exam. You can find the new subject in **./subject/subject.en.txt**.


## How-to

I've created a mini tester **./grademe.sh**.

To test your code, replace the code in **./rendu/mini_serv.c** with your own code and execute **./grademe.sh**.

The tester will automatically create a file **./trace** with details about your failures.


## For the exam
Please feel free to use my code for your exam, or you can also test your code with the tester.
